Alusivo: A Referring Expression Generation Library
==================================================

Alusivo helps with the task of selecting discriminant properties for a
given entity (the *referent*) when it is to be distinguished from a
set of entities competing for the hearer's attention (the
*confusors*).

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referring_expression_generation for a
general introduction to the topic.

Alusivo is heavily built on RDF using the Sesame framework.
